# Overview

Pocket Pantry is an app that helps users keep track of the inventory in their pantry.
As a software developer who wants to create solutions for homemakers, I am trying to learn Kotlin to develop my project into an android app.

With Pocket Pantry, users can add items and indicate their unit weight or volume, quantity, price, and notes. Users can include is the category of the item such as grains or vegetables.

Users can generate a list of their inventory and filter it by category.
